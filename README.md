# The OPUS software

This is the home page of the OPUS software, the Optical Packet
switching Universal Solver. It evaluates optical packet-switched
networks by both simulation and analysis.

We model networks of any topology with nodes of any degree and any
number of wavelengths. The network configuration is given by a
Graphviz file.  Moreover, you can load the network with any traffic
matrix.

This software produced the results for this article:
