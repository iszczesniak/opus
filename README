The Optical Packet Universal Solver solves (OPUS) by simulation or
analysis optical packet-switched networks.  The number of incoming and
outgoing fibers at a node can be any.  The number of wavelength and
length of those fibers can be any too.  The topology of the network
can also be any.

I work on OPUS on Debian.  It builds and works there.  Please report
any issues that you might have.

INSTALLATION
------------

You need the development files for the GNU Scientific Library.  I
installed it from packages.

You need to have the Boost libraries.  I installed them from packages.
You need also the development libraries of:

- boost regex
- boost program options
- boost graph
- boost serialization

Once you installed the Boost libaries and the GNU Scientific Library,
you can build OPUS: just type "make".  You might need to edit the
Makefile to point to the location of needed libraries.

When you builded OPUS, go to the runs subdirectory and type "make"
again.  This should run the simulation and analysis.  If the dynamic
libraries are installed in some specific directory, point it out in
Bash with:

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib

OPTIONAL: After you build OPUS, you can run a number of unit tests.
Go to the test directory and type "make".
